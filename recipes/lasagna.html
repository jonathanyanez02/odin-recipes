                as

                <li>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F.
                    Cover
                    it
                    with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's
                    important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
                </li>
                <Li>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that
                    it
                    will
                    change the texture of the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the
                    leftovers
                    with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the
                    sauce
                    is
                    bubbly.</Li>
                <Li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
                    Stir
                    in
                    crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
                    basil, 1
                    teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
                    stirring
                    occasionally.</Li>
